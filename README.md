#Platypus
Easily manage your development projects in one place.

##What is it?
As a web developer that regularly does client work, and with the growing
number of recommended development methods such as pre-processing and
task managment, I've gotten sick to death of manually finding
resources, opening and cd'ing in terminal windows, setting up
each task, and opening artwork.

The idea of Platypus is to prevent this mess by setting up a project
once, and simply pressing "Launch project", which fire up everything
required for the working on the job.

###Why not just Sublime / Atom project management?
All IDE project management tools are awesome, but with my line of work,
I need so much more, constantly. Utilising Platypus is great for automatically
launching artwork and beginning task runners with little effort.

###Development
As you may notice, the only true file in the repository right now is a 
mock-up SVG. I'll be hacking away at the idea in spare time.
I'll power the thing in NodeJS and node-webkit for cross platform excellence.
